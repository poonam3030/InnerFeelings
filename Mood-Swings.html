    <h2>You must learn to let go. Release the stress.You were never in control anyway.</h2>
		<p class="paragraph"><h1><center><b><u>Mood Swings</u></b></center></h1>
    <ul>*A mood swing is a sudden or intense change in emotional state. During a mood swing, a person may quickly switch from feeling happy and upbeat to feeling sad, irritable, or angry.</ul>
    <ul>*There can be many different causes for mood swings. Some mood swings can be classified as normal/healthy reactions, such as grief processing, adverse effects of substances/drugs, or a result of sleep deprivation. Mood swings can also be a sign of psychiatric illnesses in the absence of external triggers or stressors.</ul>
    <ul>*Changes in a person's energy level, sleep patterns, self-esteem, concentration, drug or alcohol use can be signs of an oncoming mood disorder.</ul>
   <ul>*The hyperactivity sometimes accompanied by inattentiveness, impulsiveness, and forgetfulness are cardinal symptoms associated with ADHD. As a result, ADHD is known to bring about usually short-lived (though sometimes dramatic) mood swings. The communication difficulties associated with autism, and the associated changes in neurochemistry, are also known to cause autistic fits (autistic mood swings).[12] The seizures associated with epilepsy involve changes in the brain's electrical firing, and thus may also bring about striking and dramatic mood swings.[9] If the mood swing is not associated with a mood disorder, treatments are harder to assign. Most commonly, however, mood swings are the result of dealing with stressful and/or unexpected situations in daily life.</ul>

	<h1><center><u><b>Symptoms and patterns</b></u></center></h1>
	<br><b>Common mood disorders that affect either sex include:</b>
	<ul><h4><b>Bipolar disorder:</b></h4></ul>
	<ul>*Bipolar disorder occurs when a person experiences periods of extreme emotional highs and lows (mania) and depression. These ups and downs can happen infrequently or several times a year.</ul>
	<br>
	<h4><b>Major depressive disorder (MDD):</b></h4>
	<ul>*MDD affects more than 16.1 million adults in the United States and is more common in women than in men. People with MDD experience persistent feelings of sadness and a loss of interest in the things they usually love.</ul>

	<ul>*Depression affects a person's mood, daily life, and relationships. Most people with depression experience several episodes of a bad mood in their lifetime. However, they can have periods of happiness and good humor in between.</ul>

	<h4><b>Cyclothymia:</b></h4>
	<ul>*Cyclothymia, or cyclothymic disorder, occurs when a person experiences emotional ups and downs. It is similar to bipolar disorder but is less serious and less common.</ul>

	<h4><b>Persistent depressive disorder (PDD):</b></h4>
 	<ul>*This form of depression was formerly known as dysthymia. People with PDD experience long-term bad mood feelings that persist for at least 2 years.</ul>
 	<ul>*The signs of PDD are not as severe as those of MDD, but they can have a significant impact on a person's life and relationships. The disease affects about 1.5% of adults in the United States each year.</ul>

 	<h4><b>Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)</b></h4>
 	<ul>*A person with BPD may experience intense mood swings and self-image problems, and they may have difficulty managing their behavior. People with BPD have an intense fear of abandonment and tend to have unstable relationships.</ul>
 	<ul>*According to some studies, 5.9% of people will suffer from BPD at some point in their life.</ul>

	<h1><center><u><b>Contributing factors and prevention</b></u></center></h1>
	<br>
	<h4><b>Triggers/Risk Factors for Mood Swings</b></h4>
	<p>Irrespective of the presence of any of the above conditions or not, certain risk factors can trigger mood changes including</p>
	<ul>*Stressful life</ul>
	<ul>*Life changing events (death of a loved one, shifting residence)</ul>
	<ul>*Improper diet</ul>
	<ul>*Inadequate sleep</ul>
	<br>
	<b>You might be able to regulate your moods if you do the following:</b>
	<ul>*<b>Keep a schedule.</b> Try to create a routine for yourself, especially when it comes to eating and sleeping.</ul>
	<ul>*<b>Exercise regularly.</b> Exercising regularly has numerous benefits for nearly all aspects of your health, including mood.</ul>
	<ul>*<b>Get sufficient sleep.</b> A good night’s sleep is important, and sleep deprivation can affect your mood.</ul>
	<ul>*<b>Eat a healthy diet.</b> A balanced, healthy diet can improve your mood and keep you healthy. Here are some tips to sticking to a healthy diet.</ul>
	<ul>*<b>Practice relaxation.</b> Engage in calming practices like yoga or meditation.</ul>
	<ul>*<b>Avoid stress.</b> Easier said than done, right? If you can’t avoid it, aim to manage and relieve stress as it comes.</ul>
	<ul>*<b>Express yourself.</b> Find a creative outlet to express yourself.</ul>
	<br>
	<p>Keeping a journal to record your significant shifts in mood might also help you determine the reasons you experience them. Look for patterns and try to avoid situations or activities that directly impact your mood. Sharing the mood journal with your doctor can also help with your diagnosis.</p>

	<h1><center><u><b>Diagnosis and treatment</b></u></center></h1>
	There are effective treatments for depression. 
	<br>
	<ul>Your doctor may perform a physical examination to rule out physiological causes for symptoms, such as a thyroid problem, other illnesses, or a vitamin deficiency. The doctor will ask about your medical history, any medications you are taking, and whether you or any family members have been diagnosed with a mood disorder. A mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, will conduct an interview or survey, asking questions about your symptoms, sleeping and eating habits, and other behavior.</ul>
	<ul>Treatment will depend on the specific illness and symptoms that are present. Usually, therapy involves a combination of medication and psychotherapy (also called “talk therapy”). Therapy sessions may be conducted by a psychologist, psychiatrist, or other health professional.</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<ul><b>Medications to treat depression and/or bipolar disorders</b></ul>
	<ul>*<b>Antidepressants</b>Many different medications are available to treat depression and depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. Some of the most widely used drugs are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These include citalopram (Celexa®), escitalopram (Lexapro®), sertraline (Zoloft®), fluoxetine (Prozac®), and paroxetine (Paxil®). Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine (Cymbalta®) and venlafaxine (Effexor®) also are commonly prescribed and are similar to SSRIs in their action. Bupropion (Wellbutrin®) is used to treat depression and seasonal affective disorder. It works differently than SSRIs or SNRIs. Older types of antidepressants include tricylic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and tetracyclic antidepressants. Although different types are found to work equally well, some antidepressants may be more effective depending on the individual. It is important to take the antidepressants as prescribed and continue taking them even if you feel better. Usually an antidepressant must be taken as prescribed for 4 to 6 weeks before it begins to work.</ul>
	<ul><b>Mood stabilizers</b>These medications help to regulate the mood swings that occur with bipolar disorder or other disorders. They reduce abnormal brain activity. Mood stabilizers may also be prescribed along with antidepressants in some cases. Some of the most widely used mood stabilizers include lithium and anticonvulsant drugs, such as valproic acid (Valproic®), lamotrigine (Lamictal®), carbamazepine (Tegretol®), and oxecarbazepine (Trileptal®).</ul>
	<ul><b>Antipsychotics</b>Patients with bipolar disorder who experience mania or mixed episodes may be treated with an atypical antipsychotic drug, such as aripiprazole (Abilify®). Atypical antipsychotics may also sometimes be used to treat depression, if symptoms are not controlled with an antidepressant alone.</ul>

	<h1><center><u><b>WHO response</b></u></center></h1>
	<ul>Mood swings, or rapid changes in one's emotional state, may occur as a reaction to circumstances or environment, as a result of a physical or mental health condition, or for no apparent reason. General moodiness is likely to be a part of everyone's life, but in some circumstances, changes in mood may be severe and have an effect on health and daily function.</ul>
	<br>
	<ul>When rapid or frequent mood shifts seem to occur without a cause or when they affect one's behavior, well-being, or typical function, the support of a therapist or other mental health professional may be helpful.</ul>
