        <h2>"There is HOPE, even when your brain tells you there isn't"</h2>
      <p class="paragraph"><h1><center><b><u>Anxiety</u></b></center></h1>
        <br>
        Anxiety as “an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes like increased blood pressure.”
        
        Knowing the difference between normal feelings of anxiety and an anxiety disorder requiring medical attention can help a person identify and treat the condition.
        Anxiety is both a mental and physical state of negative expectation. Mentally it is characterized by increased arousal and apprehension tortured into distressing worry, and physically by unpleasant activation of multiple body systems—all to facilitate response to an unknown danger, whether real or imagined.

      <h1>Contributing factors and prevention</h1>
      <b>What causes anxiety disorders?</b>
      Anxiety disorders are like other forms of mental illness. They don’t come from personal weakness, character flaws or problems with upbringing. But researchers don’t know exactly what causes anxiety disorders. They suspect a combination of factors plays a role:
      
     <br> *Chemical imbalance: Severe or long-lasting stress can change the chemical balance that controls your mood. Experiencing a lot of stress over a long period can lead to an anxiety disorder.
     <br> *Environmental factors: Experiencing a trauma might trigger an anxiety disorder, especially in someone who has inherited a higher risk to start.
     <br> *Heredity: Anxiety disorders tend to run in families. You may inherit them from one or both parents, like eye color.
      <br>

      <b>How does medication treat anxiety disorders?</b>
      Medications can’t cure an anxiety disorder. But they can improve symptoms and help you function better. Medications for anxiety disorders often include:

Anti-anxiety medications, such as benzodiazepines, may decrease your anxiety, panic and worry. They work quickly, but you can build up a tolerance to them. That makes them less effective over time. Your healthcare provider may prescribe an anti-anxiety medication for the short-term, then taper you off or the provider may add an antidepressant to the mix.
Antidepressants can also help with anxiety disorders. They tweak how your brain uses certain chemicals to improve mood and reduce stress. Antidepressants may take some time to work, so be patient. If you feel like you’re ready to stop taking antidepressants, talk to your provider first.
Beta-blockers, usually used for high blood pressure, can help reduce some of the physical symptoms of anxiety disorders. They can relieve rapid heartbeat, shaking and trembling.

      <b>How does psychotherapy treat anxiety disorders?</b>
      Psychotherapy, or counseling, helps you deal with your emotional response to the illness. A mental health provider talks through strategies to help you better understand and manage the disorder. Approaches include:

      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most common type of psychotherapy used with anxiety disorders. CBT for anxiety teaches you to recognize thought patterns and behaviors that lead to troublesome feelings. You then work on changing them.
      Exposure therapy focuses on dealing with the fears behind the anxiety disorder. It helps you engage with activities or situations you may have been avoiding. Your provider may also use relaxation exercises and imagery with exposure therapy.

      <b>When to see a doctor
    </b>
    Anxiety affects everyone from time to time, but if you find it does not go away or is affecting you severely, it might be time to seek help.
<br>
Signs that it’s a good idea to see a doctor include the following:
<br>
*Anxiety is affecting your work, studies, or other aspects of daily life.
*You feel worried or distressed about your symptoms or anxiety levels.
*You are using alcohol or other substances to manage anxiety.
*You think there may be an underlying mental health problem.
*You are having suicidal thoughts.
*You have had treatment for anxiety before, and now it has come back.

      <b>Takeway</b>
      <p>Experts don’t know the exact causes of anxiety disorders. Genetics, environment, and personal history likely play a part.

        If you have symptoms of anxiety that are worrying you or are not going away, make an appointment with your doctor.
        
        They can help diagnose it and create a treatment plan to address your symptoms. They may recommend lifestyle changes, counseling, medications, or other interventions.
        
        Some medical conditions and medications can produce symptoms similar to anxiety. In these cases, your doctor will likely treat your underlying condition or adjust your medication regimen.</p>
