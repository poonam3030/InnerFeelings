    <h2>"You must learn to let go. Release the stress.You were never in control anyway"</h2>
  <p class="paragraph"><h1><center><b><u>Stress</u></b></center></h1>
    <br>*Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous.
   <br>* Stress is your body's reaction to a challenge or demand. In short bursts, stress can be positive, such as when it helps you avoid danger or meet a deadline. But when stress lasts for a long time, it may harm your health.
   <br>*Stress is a normal feeling. There are two main types of stress:
   <ul>*<b>Acute stress.</b> This is short-term stress that goes away quickly. You feel it when you slam on the brakes, have a fight with your partner, or ski down a steep slope. It helps you manage dangerous situations. It also occurs when you do something new or exciting. All people have acute stress at one time or another.</ul>
   <ul>*<b>Chronic stress.</b> This is stress that lasts for a longer period of time. You may have chronic stress if you have money problems, an unhappy marriage, or trouble at work. Any type of stress that goes on for weeks or months is chronic stress. You can become so used to chronic stress that you don't realize it is a problem. If you don't find ways to manage stress, it may lead to health problems.</ul>
   <br><b>STRESS AND YOUR BODY</b>
   <ul>Your body reacts to stress by releasing hormones. These hormones make your brain more alert, cause your muscles to tense, and increase your pulse. In the short term, these reactions are good because they can help you handle the situation causing stress. This is your body's way of protecting itself.</ul>

<h1><center><u><b>Symptoms and patterns</b></u></center></h1>
  <br>Stress can affect our emotions, our body and how we behave, in lots of different ways. Sometimes when we are stressed, we might be able to tell right away. But at other times, we might keep going without recognising the signs.

  <ul>*Irritable, angry, impatient or wound up</ul>
  <ul>*Over-burdened or overwhelmed</ul>
  <ul>*Anxious, nervous or afraid</ul>
  <ul>*Like your thoughts are racing and you can't switch off</ul>
  <ul>*Unable to enjoy yourself</ul>
  <ul>*Uninterested in life</ul>
  <ul>*Like you've lost your sense of humour</ul>
  <ul>*A sense of dread</ul>

  <h1>Contributing factors and prevention</h1>

  *Many things can cause stress. You might feel stressed because of one big event or situation in your life. Or it might be a build-up of lots of smaller things.

  *This might make it harder for you to identify what's making you feel stressed, or to explain it to other people.

  *<b>You may experience stress if you:</b>

  <ul>*Feel under lots of pressure</ul>
  <ul>*Face big changes in your life</ul>
  <ul>*Are worried about something</ul>
  <ul>*Don't have much or any control over the outcome of a situation</ul>
  <ul>*Have responsibilities that you find overwhelming</ul>
  <ul>*Don't have enough work, activities or change in your life</ul>
  <ul>*Experience discrimination, hate or abuse</ul>
  <ul>*Are going through a period of uncertainty</ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Why do certain things make me feel stressed?</b>
  <ul>*How comfortable you feel in certain types of situation</ul>
  <ul>*What else you are going through at the time</ul>
  <ul>*Your past experiences, and how these affect the way you feel about yourself</ul>
  <ul>*The resources you have available to you, such as time and money</ul>
  <ul>*The amount of support you have from other people</ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  Some situations that don't bother you at all might cause someone else a lot of stress. This is because we are all influenced by different experiences. We also have different levels of support and ways of coping.

  Certain events might also make you feel stressed sometimes, but not every time. 

  For example, if you go shopping for food with enough time and money, you may not feel stressed. But you might feel stressed if you have lots of other things to do, have a tight budget, or need to buy food for a big event.

  *<b>Many things can cause stress in different areas of our lives. These may include:</b>

  <ul>*Pregnancy and becoming a parent</ul>
  <ul>*Infertility and problems having children</ul>

  <b>How is stress diagnosed?</b>
  <ul>Stress is subjective — not measurable with tests. Only the person experiencing it can determine whether it's present and how severe it feels. A healthcare provider may use questionnaires to understand your stress and how it affects your life.

If you have chronic stress, your healthcare provider can evaluate symptoms that result from stress. For example, high blood pressure can be diagnosed and treated</ul>
  <b>What are some strategies for stress relief?</b>
  <ul>You can’t avoid stress, but you can stop it from becoming overwhelming by practicing some daily strategies:</ul>
  <br>
  <ul>*Exercise when you feel symptoms of stress coming on. Even a short walk can boost your mood.</ul>
  <ul>*At the end of each day, take a moment to think about what you’ve accomplished — not what you didn’t get done.</ul>
  <ul>*Set goals for your day, week and month. Narrowing your view will help you feel more in control of the moment and long-term tasks.</ul>
  <ul>*Consider talking to a therapist or your healthcare provider about your worries.</ul>
